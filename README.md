# üèè Match Analysis - India vs USA üáÆüá≥ üÜö üá∫üá∏

Welcome to the Match Analysis project! This project aims to analyze the thrilling T20 Cricket World Cup match between India and USA, held in 2024. We provide detailed insights and visualizations using Scatter and Bar plots.

## üìã Project Overview

The Match Analysis project focuses on analyzing the key aspects of the India vs USA match. We dive deep into the performance of both teams, highlighting the standout moments and players.

## üìä Data Analysis

### Scatter Plot

To visualize the performance of individual players, we use Scatter plots. These plots showcase various statistics such as runs scored, wickets taken, and batting strike rate. By analyzing these plots, we can identify the top performers and their impact on the match.
Here is the scatter plot of the run progression through the innings, which in cricket terminology, is also known as **Worm**.

### Bar Plot

For a broader view of team performance, we utilize Bar plots. These plots provide insights into team statistics such as total runs scored, total wickets taken, and run rate. By examining these plots, we can understand the overall performance of each team. The following Bar plot depicts the partnerships of the Indian batsmen as the overs progresses.
